# GPix
GPix - An unofficial Google Images API.

## API
API-end-point: http://theapache64.xyz:8080/gpix/v1

#### How to use the API ?
**Step 1 - Obtain the API key.**

To get the API key, visit http://theapache64.xyz:8080/gpix/v1/get_api_key?email=[YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS]
where [YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS] is your email address.

Then we'll send your API key to the given email.

**Step 2 -Finally, Get the result JSON**

Attach the API key either with `Authorization` header or request parameter `Authorization` and give a `GET` or `POST` request to http://theapache64.xyz:8080/gpix/v1/gpix?keyword=[KEYWORD].
where [KEYWORD] is the keyword you want to search, for example : Car, Jacob Black etc.

#### API Usage example

To get the API key

`GET` - http://theapache64.xyz:8080/gpix/v1/get_api_key?email=[YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS-GOES-HERE]

Result - 
```json
{
    "message": "API key sent to your-email-address",
    "error": false,
    "error_code": 0
}
```

To get 50 images of Audi. (here am using the test API key with the GET request)
GET - http://theapache64.xyz:8080/gpix/v1/gpix?Authorization=testApiKey&keyword=Audi&limit=50

```json
{
  "message": "50 images(s) available",
  "error": false,

      },
      ...
    ]
